influenced by satisfaction and bien-etre
obstacles present, gifts gratification or attention, vigilance, now
best I can arrive Love passion affinity friendship
my own I can use art and science creative intelligence
past of matters utility, interest, responsability
current that is coming into action negligence, absence, carelessness, apathy
my attitude is passion, physical ardor
my env is calm, peace and city I live in
hopes and fear contrarieties, difficultes, intrigues and analogies
final flash is intimated by design - pain, affliction, tear, sadness


Inspired by a moment of satisfaction, looking at some absences and apathies/negligencies, I will try to improve some inter-personal relationship using my creativity and my passion. 
Unfortunately everything will be calm, peaceful, but a past of utilities and responsibilities, joined with some resistances and difficulties, will lead to pain and sadness.
